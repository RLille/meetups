Dear all,

R Lille (R User Group) will be hosting a meetup on Thursday, the
7<sup><i style="font-size:0.5em;">th</i></sup> of April, 2022 - 18:00
CET, with Florian Privé.

*\[Abstract\]*  
R package {bigstatsr} (<https://github.com/privefl/bigstatsr>) provides
functions for fast statistical analysis of large-scale data encoded as
matrices. The package can handle matrices that are too large to fit in
memory. Package bigstatsr is based on a similar format (called `FBM`) as
the format `big.matrix` provided by the R package {bigmemory}. Package
{bigstatsr} enables users with a laptop to perform statistical analysis
of several dozens of gigabytes of data, and HPC users to handle matrices
of hundreds of GB. The package is fast and efficient because of four
different reasons. First, {bigstatsr} is memory-efficient because it
uses only small chunks of data at a time. Second, special care has been
taken to implement effective algorithms. Third, `FBM` objects use
memory-mapping, which provides efficient accesses to matrices. Finally,
as matrices are stored on-disk, many processes can easily access them in
parallel.

The main features currently available in {bigstatsr} are:

-   truncated SVD/PCA,
-   penalized linear/logistic regressions,
-   column-wise linear/logistic regressions tests,
-   matrix operations,
-   parallelization / split-apply-combine stategy.

In this webinar, I will present this package and its features, as well
as quickly present two other packages, {bigsparser}, which provides an
on-disk sparse matrix format, and {bigsnpr}, which extends {bigstatsr}
to provide specific tools for analyzing genotype data.

*\[Bio\]*  
Florian Privé is a senior researcher in predictive human genetics, fond
of Data Science and an R(cpp) enthusiast. He is also the founder and
former organizer of the Grenoble R user group. You can find him on
Twitter and GitHub as @privefl.

*\[A Propos\]*  
This event (in English) is organised by the R Lille user group
(<https://rlille.fr/>) (Lille, France).

*The meetup will be recorded and made available on YouTube
(<http://youtube.rlille.fr/>).*

If you are using R in your work or for fun and you want to learn new
tricks, tips or simply to share and enjoy being part of friendly
(worldwide) community, you should consider joining your local R User
Group, which is R Lille (<https://rlille.fr/>).  
We are always looking for speakers for “conference” talks (\~1 hour),
lightning talks (\~20 minutes) and workshops.  
If you want to participate, it’s quite simple:

-   Pick a subject.
-   Tell us when you want to talk.
-   In French preferably, but English is welcome as well, especially for
    a worldwide audience.
